# ML-KEM Project Status and Tasks

## CRITICAL UPDATE: Major Progress on Root Cause

âœ… **Fixed KAT Validation Framework** - KAT tests now perform real cryptographic validation instead of just checking lengths

âœ… **Updated to Correct NIST KAT Vectors** - Replaced fabricated test vectors with official NIST ML-KEM-768 vectors

âœ… **Verified Parameters Match NIST Standard** - Our K=3, SECRETKEYBYTES=2400, etc. match NIST specification exactly

âœ… **Fixed Multiple KEM Implementation Issues**:
   - Corrected `buf` population in encryption (was overwriting entire buffer, now correctly sets buf[0..32] and buf[32..64])
   - Fixed `cmov` function to match NIST reference (constant-time implementation)
   - Fixed `verify` function to match NIST reference (constant-time comparison)

ðŸ”´ **REMAINING CRITICAL ISSUE**: KEM shared secrets still don't match
   - Both our own test (encrypt â†’ decrypt) and NIST KAT tests fail
   - All 100 NIST KAT tests fail with "Decrypted shared secret does not match expected value"
   - This indicates a fundamental bug in either encryption or decryption logic

## Current Status: Implementation Partially Fixed but Core Bug Remains

### Working Components âœ…

* **Parameters**: Correctly match NIST ML-KEM-768 specification
* **Hash Functions**: SHA3-256, SHA3-512, SHAKE256 working correctly
* **Verify/CMov**: Now match NIST reference implementation
* **KAT Framework**: Properly validates against real NIST vectors
* **Key Generation**: Appears to work correctly

### Broken Components ðŸ”´

* **KEM Encryption/Decryption**: Shared secrets don't match - fundamental algorithm bug
* **All KAT Tests**: 0/100 passing with official NIST vectors

## Priority Tasks

### Immediate (Critical)

1. **Debug KEM Algorithm** - Root cause shared secret mismatch between enc/dec
2. **Compare Step-by-Step with NIST Reference** - Identify where our algorithm diverges
3. **Fix Core Cryptographic Bug** - Ensure KEM encrypt/decrypt produces matching shared secrets

### High Priority

4. **Validate KAT Tests** - Should pass all 100 NIST vectors once core bug is fixed
5. **Test Edge Cases** - Verify robustness once main algorithm works

## Technical Notes

* **Recent Fixes Applied**: Corrected encryption buffer handling, fixed cmov/verify to match NIST
* **Root Cause**: Despite these fixes, fundamental KEM algorithm issue persists
* **Investigation Strategy**: Need detailed step-by-step comparison with NIST reference implementation

## Final Status

**IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**: ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL BUG** - Core KEM algorithm broken, no KAT tests passing

*The implementation has made significant progress with multiple fixes applied, but a critical bug in the KEM encrypt/decrypt logic prevents any test vectors from passing. This requires immediate focused debugging of the core algorithm.*
