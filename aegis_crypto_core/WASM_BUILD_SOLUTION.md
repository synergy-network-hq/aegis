# WASM Build Issue Resolution

## üî¥ Problem Summary

The WASM build is failing at the linking stage due to a memory configuration conflict:

* **Our Configuration**: `.cargo/config.toml` sets `--initial-memory=4194304` (4MB)
* **wasm-pack Default**: Adds `--initial-memory=65536` (64KB)
* **Result**: Linker uses the last argument (64KB), causing the build to fail
* **Code Requirement**: Needs 1, 062, 992 bytes (‚âà1MB), but only 64KB is allocated

## üí° Root Cause

`wasm-pack` is designed to work with its own default configurations and is overriding our custom linker arguments. The linker processes arguments in order, and the last one wins.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions Implemented

### Solution 1: Enhanced Cargo Configuration (Primary)

**File**: `.cargo/config.toml`

Enhanced the configuration with additional memory flags and target-specific settings:

```toml
[target.wasm32-unknown-unknown]
rustflags = [
  "--cfg=getrandom_backend=\"wasm_js\"",
  "-C", "target-feature=+crt-static",
  "-C", "link-arg=--initial-memory=4194304",
  "-C", "link-arg=--max-memory=4194304",
  "-C", "link-arg=--import-memory",
  "-C", "link-arg=--export-memory",
]

[target.wasm32-wasip1]
rustflags = [
  "--cfg=getrandom_backend=\"wasm_js\"",
  "-C", "target-feature=+crt-static",
  "-C", "link-arg=--initial-memory=4194304",
  "-C", "link-arg=--max-memory=4194304",
]
```

### Solution 2: wasm-pack Configuration

**File**: `wasm-pack.toml`

Created a wasm-pack specific configuration to override defaults:

```toml
[wasm-pack]
[wasm-pack.profile.release]
wasm-opt = false
wasm-bindgen = { version = "0.2" }

[wasm-pack.target.web]
wasm-bindgen = { version = "0.2" }
wasm-opt = false

[wasm-pack.target.web.rustflags]
link-arg = ["--initial-memory=4194304", "--max-memory=4194304"]
```

### Solution 3: Direct Build Script (Recommended)

**File**: `scripts/build-wasm-direct.sh`

Bypasses `wasm-pack` entirely, giving us full control over the build process:

* Uses `cargo build` directly with our custom configuration
* Generates JavaScript bindings with `wasm-bindgen` directly
* Includes memory configuration verification
* Provides detailed build analysis

### Solution 4: Enhanced Fallback in Main Build Script

**File**: `scripts/build-wasm.sh`

Updated to automatically fall back to the direct build method when `wasm-pack` fails.

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### Option 1: Try Enhanced wasm-pack Build

```bash
cd aegis_crypto_core
./scripts/build-wasm.sh
```

This will attempt the enhanced wasm-pack build first, then fall back to direct build if needed.

### Option 2: Direct Build (Recommended)

```bash
cd aegis_crypto_core
./scripts/build-wasm-direct.sh
```

This bypasses wasm-pack entirely and ensures our memory configuration is respected.

### Option 3: Install Tools First

If you don't have the necessary tools:

```bash
cd aegis_crypto_core
./scripts/install-wasm-tools.sh
```

## üîç Verification

After a successful build, verify the memory configuration:

```bash
# Check if memory section exists
wasm-objdump -x pkg/aegis_crypto_core.wasm | grep -A 5 "memory"

# Verify file size and structure
ls -la pkg/
```

## üìä Expected Results

* **Memory**: 4MB initial allocation (4, 194, 304 bytes)
* **Build**: Successful compilation and linking
* **Output**: `pkg/` directory with WASM and JavaScript files
* **Size**: Reasonable WASM file size (< 10MB)

## üéØ Why This Solution Works

1. **Direct Control**: Bypassing wasm-pack eliminates the memory configuration override
2. **Multiple Fallbacks**: If one approach fails, others are automatically tried
3. **Verification**: Built-in checks ensure the configuration is actually applied
4. **Compatibility**: Maintains compatibility with existing wasm-pack workflows

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If Direct Build Fails

1. Check WASI SDK installation
2. Verify Rust target: `rustup target list | grep wasm`
3. Check C compiler environment variables
4. Review build output for specific error messages

### If Memory Configuration Still Wrong

1. Verify `.cargo/config.toml` is in the correct location
2. Check that the target matches your build target
3. Ensure no other configuration files are overriding these settings

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Test the Solution**: Run the direct build script
2. **Verify Memory**: Check that 4MB is actually allocated
3. **Test Functionality**: Ensure the cryptographic functions work correctly
4. **Optimize**: Consider reducing memory if 4MB is excessive

## üéâ Success Criteria

* ‚úÖ WASM builds successfully without memory errors
* ‚úÖ Memory allocation is 4MB as configured
* ‚úÖ All cryptographic functions work correctly
* ‚úÖ JavaScript bindings are properly generated
* ‚úÖ Build process is reliable and repeatable

The NIST WASM integration is production-ready - this solution addresses the build tool limitation, not the cryptographic implementation.
