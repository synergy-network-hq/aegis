# Aegis Quantum Cryptography Core: Technical Specification

## 1. Introduction
Aegis is a next-generation quantum cryptography core engineered for the post-quantum era.
It provides a modular, high-assurance foundation for blockchain systems, secure messaging, digital identity, and critical infrastructure.
Aegis enables deterministic, auditable, and FIPS-compliant cryptography for the highest security applications.

---

## 2. Core Features & Architecture
- **Modular architecture:** Pluggable algorithm modules for post-quantum and classic cryptography
- **Deterministic, auditable signing and verification**
- **no_std compatible** (embedded/WASM ready)
- **Constant-time, side-channel resistant execution**
- **Secure zeroization** of secrets

---

## 3. Supported Standards

Aegis natively supports:
- **FIPS 203 - Kyber (ML-KEM)**
- **FIPS 204 - Dilithium (ML-DSA)**
- **FIPS 205 - SPHINCS+ (SLH-DSA)**
- **FIPS 206 - Falcon (FN-DSA, pending NIST finalization)**

These represent NIST’s official post-quantum cryptography standards, as of July 2025.
The forthcoming 'FIPS 207' (HQC-KEM) is planned for integration once NIST finalizes the standard in the near future, which is estimated around 2026-2027.

## 4. Technical Stack & Dependencies

- **Language:** Rust (no_std, WASM, and native)
- **Core cryptographic modules:** Kyber, Dilithium, SPHINCS+, Falcon
- **Dependencies:** `rand_core`, `sha2`, `sha3`, `zeroize`, `criterion`, etc.
- **Fuzzing:** [cargo-fuzz](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/cargo-fuzz) integration
- **CI:** GitHub Actions (test, clippy, fmt)
- **Test Vectors:** C reference vectors for validation

---

## 5. Use Cases

- Blockchain transactions (quantum-resistant signatures for smart contracts, wallets, validators)
- Secure messaging and file transfer
- Authentication, digital ID, and access control
- Supply chain and device attestation
- Post-quantum VPN and TLS integration
- Any application requiring future-proof, FIPS-compliant digital signatures

---

## 6. API Overview & Sample Code

**Example (Rust):**
```rust
use aegis::{keypair, sign, verify, Algorithm};
let (pk, sk) = keypair(Algorithm::SphincsPlus);
let msg = b"post-quantum security!";
let sig = sign(&sk, msg).unwrap();
assert!(verify(&pk, msg, &sig));
```

---

## 7. Security & Compliance

- All code written for constant-time and side-channel resistance
- Deterministic RNGs for FIPS reproducibility
- Explicit error handling (never panic/unwrap on user input)
- Zeroization for all secret material
- Each algorithm cross-tested against NIST Known Answer Tests (KATs)

---

## 8. Comparison to Other Solutions

Unlike most cryptography libraries, **Aegis is**:
- Fully modular and extensible (add/drop algorithms with minimal integration cost)
- no_std and WASM ready, not just “desktop/server”
- Built for deterministic, reproducible cryptography (FIPS-compliance as default)
- Strong emphasis on security audits, code clarity, and constant-time execution
- Designed for production blockchain and security infrastructure, not just academic use

---

## 9. Glossary of Terms

- **FIPS:** Federal Information Processing Standards (U.S. government)
- **no_std:** Rust code that does not depend on the standard library
- **WASM:** WebAssembly, for browser and embedded targets
- **NIST:** U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology
- **KAT:** Known Answer Test (test vector)
- **Deterministic:** Cryptographic output can be reproduced exactly for audit/testing
